# ESTECO
OPTIMISATION ALGORITHMS

In this project we include the main algorithms used for:

RTEA (Rolling tide evolutionary algorithm)
AMOSA (Simulated Annealing)

and the following modifications from the initial algorithms:

RTEA including random forest as a surrogate model.
AMOSA including the resampling strategy used in RTEA.
