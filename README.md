OPTIMISATION ALGORITHMS

In this project we include the main algorithms used for:

- RTEA: Rolling tide evolutionary algorithm.
- AMOSA: Simulated Annealing without using a resampling strategy.

and the following modifications from the initial algorithms:

- RTEA + Surrogate: RTEA including random forest as a surrogate model.
- AMOSA + RTEA: Simulated Annelaing including the resampling strategy used in RTEA.
