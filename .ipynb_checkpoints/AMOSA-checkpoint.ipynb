The \"PyGMO\" package shown below as \"pygmo\" is a scientific library providing a large number of optimisation problems and algorithms. This package is used to extract the non-dominated subset from a set of solutions. \"SciPy\" written below as \"scipy\", is also used to carry out single linkage clustering within the AMOSA algorithm. The remaining packages that have been implemented are used for general mathematics that is carried out within the code."
